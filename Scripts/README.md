# Daily Plan for APSU Unity Camp (formerly called "Edge")

## Day 1

1. Start with the introductory presentation.
2. Get all students to create their own Unity accounts. (This is extremely important.)
3. Start working on the [BlockSlider](BlockSlider/README.md) game.

## Day 2

1. Start work on the [Canyon Flight](CanyonFlight/README.md) game.

There are three scripts and 87 lines of code for this game. Watch the video. I think the final part will be difficult to code.

## Day 3

1. Start work on the [Brick Breaker](BrickBreaker/README.md) game.

Brick Breaker (or Breakout) is a 3D game. I didn't make a video on this, but there is a video on Youtube in which I adapted my own version of this game.

## Day 4

I'll come up with a platform game.

## Day 5

1. Start work on [Zombie FPS](ZombieFPS/README.md) game.

This is a super easy and fun game to make and the kids love to shoot zombies. I need to make a video on this. This is a great way to end the week.
