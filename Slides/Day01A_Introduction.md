# What are games?

. . .

- Games are a structured form of play.
- Games have three components.
    - Rules
    - One or more goals.
    - Choice

## Rules

A game should have rules.

- Rules dictate what a player is allowed to do and the order in which they are allowed to do it.
- An activity with a goal and choice but without rules is considered "puzzle".
    - Jigsaw Puzzles
    - Rubric's Cube

## Goals

A game should have one or more goals.

- Goals motivate the players to keep playing to an objective.
- Some games can have multiple objectives, any one of which triggers the end of the game.
- An activity without goals will cause the players to do one of two things:
    - Implicitly create their own goals to fill the void.
    - Get bored and do something else.

## Choice

A game should allow a player to make choices.

- Choices allow the player to control their destiny.
- Activities with rules and goals but without choice are called "Games of Chance".
    - Candyland
    - War
    - Snakes and Ladders
    - Slot Machines
    - Lottery

## Video games

- Video games have been with us since the 1960s since computer scientists began working on interactive demonstrations for their new computers.
- The first video game was called "Spacewar!" and was developed at MIT in 1962.
- The game involves two space ships flying around a 2D space. The goal of each ship is to shoot the other.

## How video games are made.

- Spacewar was created using assembly language on the PDP-1.
